## Function for making homogeneous zones out of heterogenous MZ raster.
#
# Arguments:
#   rast_in:
#       character string: Management Zone Raster. Must be a format handled by GDAL.
#       character vector: RasterLayer to use as input, single-band.
#           Must be a format handled by GDAL.
#   
# Maintains:
#   Environment
#   Input files
#
# On violation:
#   Stops script
#
# Returns:
#   A large list SpatialPolygonsDataFrame.
#   The amount of Management Zones equals the amount of elements.

#rm(list = ls())  # Clear the workspace!
#ls() ## no objects left in the workspace
#start.time = Sys.time()


# INTO THE FUNCTION
