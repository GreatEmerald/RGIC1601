aria2 1.23.0
============

Release Note
------------

This release fixes several bugs reported by users, and adds several
new features.  Read the following section for details.

Changes
-------

* Simplify cache write

  The previous cache write routine was too complex.  I'm sure I can
  rewrite it to more elegantly.  But the primary motivation of this
  complex logic is for disk activity reduction on Windows 7, and I
  observed it on my old IDE disk.  I checked it again recently, and
  there is no difference between with and without this complex logic.
  For this reason, it was removed.  Will revert this change if many of
  users are not happy with this.
